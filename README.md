Hey my name is Lucas and
- I'm taking software engineering at the University of Victoria and I love whitewater kayaking and spending time outside
- I've done projects with arduino boards and neural networks in addition to my class work
- Currently I'm interested and studying up on creating actual software products for users
- I am also doing fun small projects to learn new things and learn a variety of different tools, which may be my favorite thing about SEng

- I am looking for a coop so if any of my projects look like they could be interesting send me a message!
- I can be reached at lhatelyhoneyman@gmail.com and you can check out my website with my other socials at lhatelyhoneyman.pythonanywhere.com

Thanks for looking!
Lucas Hately-Honeyman
